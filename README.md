# Making the petlovers SocialNetwork "PawsFinder"


## 1. Project resume

There is a wide variety of social networks available for people to interact with each other. Our purpose was to create a social network focused on people who have pets. The main idea is for pet owners to connect with each other, share their experiences, and make friends with other people who share the same love for pets.
In PawsFinder, you can register with your email or with Google. It allows you to share a profile picture, the name, and characteristics of your pets. You can also make posts with information about pets, adoptions, and services for animals.
